## AGF — Agentic Git Flow

This repo is onboarded as a **`bh` hive** and develops via **AGF**: work is tracked in beads
and driven through `bh`, **not** raw `git` / `bd` / `gh`.

- **Is this repo set up for AGF?** → run `bh hive ready` (add `-v` for the line-item breakdown).
- **Lifecycle, roles, conventions:** see `docs/AGF.md` and the bh plugin's role skills.
- Drive beads with `bh work`; load the role skill for your seat (coordinator / developer / merger).
- Batch/collapsed work lives in ONE shared `wt/batch/<group>` worktree and completes as a UNIT:
  `bh work submit --group` then `bh work merge --group` — per-bead `submit`/`check` don't apply.
