## Context

These emoji were introduced as part of the incremental processing feature implementation, which includes:

- Change detection and deletion tracking
- ProcessingStateTracker for maintaining processing state

The emoji follow the project's established logging convention pattern of `logger.{level}("{emoji} {message}")` for visual clarity and consistency across all services.
