</div>

## 📋 Overview

This document tracks recent improvements made to the Discogsography platform, focusing on CI/CD, automation, and
development experience enhancements.

## 🆕 Latest Improvements (February 2026 — Continued)

### 🔴 Redis-Backed Snapshot Store — Issue #55 (February 2026)

**Overview**: Migrated `SnapshotStore` from an in-memory Python dict to Redis (`redis.asyncio`), eliminating all limitations of the previous in-memory approach.

#### Changes

- **`api/snapshot_store.py`**: Rewritten as an async Redis-backed store. `save()` and `load()` are now coroutines. TTL eviction is handled natively by Redis (`SET ... EX`) — the manual `_evict_expired()` scan is gone.
- **`api/routers/snapshot.py`**: `configure()` now accepts a `redis_client` parameter; endpoint handlers `await` the async store methods.
- **`api/api.py`**: Passes the existing `_redis` client to `_snapshot_router.configure()` at startup.
- **`explore/snapshot_store.py`**: Deleted — dead code after API consolidation (the snapshot router has lived in `api/` since issue #72).
- **`pyproject.toml`**: Added `fakeredis>=2.0.0` to dev dependencies for test isolation.
- **Tests**: `tests/api/` and `tests/explore/` snapshot tests updated to use `fakeredis.aioredis.FakeRedis` (backed by a shared `fakeredis.FakeServer` fixture); unit tests converted to `async` with `@pytest.mark.asyncio`.

#### Benefits

| Before | After |
|---|---|
| Lost on service restart | Persists across restarts (`appendonly yes`) |
| Process-local only | Shared across multiple API replicas |
| O(n) lazy eviction scan on every save | Native Redis TTL — zero overhead |
| Unbounded memory growth | Bounded by Redis `maxmemory 512mb` + LRU |

### 🔒 Security Hardening — Issue #71 (February 2026)

**Overview**: Addressed a set of security findings (issue #71) across the API service.

#### Changes

- **OAuth token encryption**: Discogs OAuth access tokens are now encrypted at rest using Fernet symmetric encryption before being stored in PostgreSQL. A new `OAUTH_ENCRYPTION_KEY` env var is required for the API container.
- **Constant-time login**: Login and registration now use constant-time comparison to prevent user enumeration via timing attacks.
- **Blind registration**: Duplicate email registration returns the same `201` response to prevent account enumeration.
- **JWT logout with JTI blacklist**: `POST /api/auth/logout` now revokes the token's `jti` claim in Redis (TTL = token expiry), making logout stateful.
- **Snapshot auth required**: `POST /api/snapshot` now requires a valid JWT token.
- **Rate limiting**: Added SlowAPI rate limits — register (3/min), login (5/min), sync (2/10min), autocomplete (30/min). Per-user sync cooldown (600 s) stored in Redis.
- **Security response headers**: All responses now include `X-Content-Type-Options`, `X-Frame-Options`, `Referrer-Policy`, and `Permissions-Policy`.
- **CORS**: Origins configurable via `CORS_ORIGINS` env var (comma-separated; disabled by default).
- **Input validation**: JWT algorithm validated to be `HS256`; Discogs API response bodies redacted from error messages.

#### Refactoring

- Extracted shared JWT helpers to `api/auth.py` (`b64url_encode/decode`, `decode_token`) — removed duplicated implementations from individual routers.
- Added `api/limiter.py` for a shared SlowAPI `Limiter` instance.
- Replaced all `type: ignore` pragmas with proper type narrowing across the codebase.

### 👤 Discogs User Integration (February 2026)

**Overview**: Full Discogs account linking, collection and wantlist sync, and personalised graph exploration.

#### Features

- **OAuth 1.0a OOB flow**: Users connect their Discogs account via `GET /api/oauth/authorize/discogs` → `POST /api/oauth/verify/discogs`. State token stored in Redis with TTL.
- **Collection & wantlist sync**: `POST /api/sync` triggers a background job in the Curator service that fetches the user's Discogs collection and wantlist and writes `COLLECTED` / `WANTS` relationships to Neo4j.
- **Sync history**: `GET /api/sync/status` returns the last 10 sync operations with status, item count, and error details.
- **User endpoints**: `/api/user/collection`, `/api/user/wantlist`, `/api/user/recommendations`, `/api/user/collection/stats`, `/api/user/status` for personalised graph data.
- **Operator setup**: Discogs app credentials configured once via the `discogs-setup` CLI bundled in the API container (reads/writes the `app_config` table).

---

### 🏗️ API Consolidation (February 2026)

**Overview**: All user-facing HTTP endpoints consolidated into the central **API service**. Explore and Curator now expose health-only endpoints.

#### Before / After

| Endpoint group        | Before                     | After              |
| --------------------- | -------------------------- | ------------------ |
| Graph queries         | Explore service (:8006)    | API service (:8004) |
| Sync triggers         | Curator service (:8010)    | API service (:8004) |
| User collection data  | (new)                      | API service (:8004) |

#### Benefits

- Single port (8004) for all client-facing API calls — simpler frontend configuration.
- Explore and Curator internal services are now health-only, reducing their attack surface.
- Shared JWT authentication and rate limiting enforced uniformly at the API layer.

---

### 🎨 Dashboard UI Redesign (February 2026)

**Overview**: Complete frontend redesign based on a new Stitch-generated dark theme.

#### Changes

- **Tailwind CSS**: Replaced hand-written CSS with Tailwind CDN (`?plugins=forms,container-queries`), Inter + JetBrains
  Mono fonts, and Material Symbols Outlined icons
- **Logo placeholder**: `<div id="app-logo">` with prominent comment block for easy brand swapping
- **Service cards**: Per-service sections (`#service-extractor`, `#service-graphinator`, `#service-tableinator`) with
  per-queue-type rows showing state/counts
- **Queue Size Metrics**: CSS height bars replace the previous Chart.js canvas — no CDN JS dependency
- **Processing Rates**: SVG circular gauges with `stroke-dashoffset` animation for publish and ack rates per queue type
- **Database cards**: `#db-neo4j` and `#db-postgresql` with status badges and live stats
- **Event log**: `#activityLog` with `.connection-status` / `.status-indicator` / `.status-text` kept for Playwright
  test compatibility
- **E2E tests updated**: `test_dashboard_ui.py` selectors updated to match the new HTML structure

#### Static Files

| File                                   | Change                                                     |
| -------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------- |
| `dashboard/static/index.html`          | Complete rewrite (dark Tailwind theme)                     |
| `dashboard/static/dashboard.js`        | Complete rewrite (Chart.js removed, SVG gauges + CSS bars) |
| `dashboard/static/styles.css`          | Simplified to base reset + legacy selector stubs           |
| `tests/dashboard/test_dashboard_ui.py` | Updated Playwright selectors                               |

### 🧹 Code Simplification & Test Coverage (February 2026)

**Overview**: Simplified service code across all five components and improved test coverage from 92% to 94%.

#### Code Simplification

Reduced complexity and improved readability across all Python and Rust services without changing behavior:

**Dashboard** (`dashboard/dashboard.py`):

- Extracted `_get_or_create_gauge()` and `_get_or_create_counter()` helpers to eliminate duplicate
  Prometheus metric registration try/except blocks
- Fixed WebSocket connection tracking to use `set.discard()` instead of `list.remove()` to avoid
  `ValueError` on double-removal, and to track connection count accurately with `Gauge.set()`
- Hardened PostgreSQL address parsing to handle addresses without an explicit port (defaults to 5432)

**Explore** (`explore/explore.py`, `explore/neo4j_queries.py`):

- Added `_run_query()`, `_run_single()`, and `_run_count()` helpers to eliminate ~20 repeated
  `async with driver.session()` blocks across all query functions
- Merged duplicate `autocomplete_genre()` and `autocomplete_style()` implementations into a single
  `_autocomplete_prefix()` helper
- Simplified `_build_categories()` using early returns instead of a mutable accumulator variable

**Graphinator** (`graphinator/graphinator.py`):

- Removed dead code branches and simplified control flow in message handlers
- Consolidated repeated node-merge patterns and deduplication logic

**Tableinator** (`tableinator/tableinator.py`):

- Simplified batch processing logic and removed redundant state tracking
- Consolidated repeated table and index creation patterns

**Extractor** (Rust, `extractor/src/`):

- Removed unused `types.rs` module entirely
- Removed dead S3 configuration fields (`s3_bucket`, `s3_region`) and `max_temp_size`
- Removed unused `from_file()` config loader (environment variables are the only supported method)
- Simplified error handling and control flow across all modules

#### Test Coverage Improvement

Increased overall test coverage from **92% → 94%** (774 → 798 tests):

| File                           | Coverage |
| ------------------------------ | -------- |
| `graphinator/graphinator.py`   | 82%      |
| `common/postgres_resilient.py` | 90%      |
| `dashboard/dashboard.py`       | 93%      |
| `tableinator/tableinator.py`   | 96%      |
| `common/rabbitmq_resilient.py` | 92%      |
| `common/neo4j_resilient.py`    | 98%      |
| `explore/explore.py`           | 97%      |

New tests cover previously untested paths including: config errors and early returns, Neo4j and
PostgreSQL connection failures, async queue edge cases (`QueueFull`/`QueueEmpty`), WebSocket
exception cleanup, batch processor flush errors in finally blocks, and missing-ID edge cases in
graph entity processing.

### 🚀 Infrastructure Upgrades (February 2026)

### 📋 State Marker System

**Problem**: When the extractor service restarted, it couldn't determine whether to continue processing, re-process, or skip already-processed Discogs data versions, potentially leading to duplicate processing or missed updates.

**Solution**: Implemented a comprehensive state marker system that tracks extraction progress across all phases.

#### Key Features

- **Version-Specific Tracking**: Each Discogs version (e.g., `20260101`) gets its own state marker file
- **Multi-Phase Monitoring**: Tracks download, processing, publishing, and overall status
- **Smart Resume Logic**: Automatically decides whether to reprocess, continue, or skip on restart
- **Per-File Progress**: Detailed tracking of individual file processing status
- **Error Recovery**: Records errors at each phase for debugging and recovery

#### Implementation

- ✅ **Rust Implementation**: `extractor/extractor/src/state_marker.rs` with 11 unit tests
- ✅ **Python Implementation**: `common/state_marker.py` with 22 unit tests
- ✅ **Documentation**: Complete usage guide in `docs/state-marker-system.md`
- ✅ **Cross-Platform**: Identical functionality in both Rust and Python extractors

#### Benefits

- **Restart Safety**: No duplicate processing after service restarts
- **Progress Visibility**: Clear view of extraction status at any time
- **Idempotency**: Safe to restart at any point without data corruption
- **Efficiency**: Skip already-completed work automatically
- **Observability**: Detailed metrics for monitoring and debugging

#### File Structure

```json
{
  "current_version": "20260101",
  "download_phase": { "status": "completed", "files_downloaded": 4, ... },
  "processing_phase": { "status": "in_progress", "files_processed": 2, ... },
  "publishing_phase": { "status": "in_progress", "messages_published": 1234567, ... },
  "summary": { "overall_status": "in_progress", ... }
}
```

#### Processing Decisions

| Scenario               | Decision      | Action                  |
| ---------------------- | ------------- | ----------------------- |
| Download failed        | **Reprocess** | Re-download everything  |
| Processing in progress | **Continue**  | Resume unfinished files |
| All completed          | **Skip**      | Wait for next check     |

See **[State Marker System](state-marker-system.md)** for complete documentation.

### 💾 State Marker Periodic Updates

**Problem**: Extractor only saved state at file boundaries (start/complete), meaning a crash during processing could lose hours of progress. State files showed 0 records even after hours of processing.

**Solution**: Implemented periodic state marker updates every 5,000 records in extractor's existing behavior.

#### Key Changes

- ✅ **Config**: Added `state_save_interval` parameter (default: 5,000 records)
- ✅ **Batcher**: Modified `message_batcher` to save state periodically during processing
- ✅ **Tests**: Updated all 125 tests to pass with new signature
- ✅ **Consistency**: Both extractors now have identical periodic save behavior

#### Benefits

- **Crash Recovery**: Resume from last checkpoint (max 5,000 records lost vs. entire file)
- **Progress Visibility**: Real-time progress updates in state file
- **Minimal Overhead**: ~1-2ms per save, ~580 saves for 2.9M records (negligible)
- **Production-Ready**: Tested with multi-million record files

#### Performance Impact

| File     | Records | Saves  | Overhead |
| -------- | ------- | ------ | -------- |
| Masters  | 2.9M    | ~580   | \<2s     |
| Releases | 20M     | ~4,000 | \<10s    |

See **[State Marker Periodic Updates](state-marker-periodic-updates.md)** for implementation details.
