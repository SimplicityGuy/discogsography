# Consumer Cancellation Feature

## Overview

The consumer cancellation feature automatically closes RabbitMQ queue consumers after files have completed processing. This helps free up resources and provides clearer monitoring of active vs. completed file processing.

## How It Works

1. When the extractor sends a "file_complete" message, both tableinator and graphinator:

   - Mark the file as complete (shows üéâ in progress reports)
   - Schedule the consumer for that queue to be canceled after a grace period
   - The default grace period is 5 minutes (300 seconds)

1. After the grace period expires:

   - The consumer for that specific queue is canceled
   - The connection and channel remain open for other queues
   - Progress reports show which consumers are active vs. canceled

1. Benefits:

   - Frees up RabbitMQ resources (connections, channels, memory)
   - Clearer monitoring - easy to see which files are still being processed
   - Prevents unnecessary network traffic for completed queues

## Configuration

### Environment Variable

- `CONSUMER_CANCEL_DELAY`: Number of seconds to wait before canceling a consumer after file completion
  - Default: 300 (5 minutes)
  - Set to 0 to disable consumer cancellation
  - Can be set per service or globally

### Examples

```bash
# Use default 5-minute delay
docker-compose up

# Use 30-second delay for faster testing
CONSUMER_CANCEL_DELAY=30 docker-compose up

# Disable consumer cancellation
CONSUMER_CANCEL_DELAY=0 docker-compose up

# Different delays per service
CONSUMER_CANCEL_DELAY=60 docker-compose up tableinator
CONSUMER_CANCEL_DELAY=120 docker-compose up graphinator
```

## Monitoring

### Progress Reports

The periodic progress reports now include consumer status:

```
üìä Progress: 1000 total messages processed (üéâ Artists: 500, Labels: 500, Masters: 0, Releases: 0)
üîå Canceled consumers: ['artists']
‚úÖ Active consumers: ['labels', 'masters', 'releases']
```

### Log Messages

Watch for these log messages:

- `üéâ File processing complete for {type}!` - File marked as complete
- `üîå Canceling consumer for {type} after {delay}s grace period` - Consumer cancellation scheduled
- `‚úÖ Consumer for {type} successfully canceled` - Consumer successfully canceled
- `‚ùå Failed to cancel consumer for {type}` - Cancellation failed (non-fatal)

## Testing

Use the provided test scripts:

1. **test_file_completion.py** - Tests the file completion message handling
1. **test_consumer_cancellation.py** - Tests and monitors consumer cancellation

```bash
# Run with short delay for testing
CONSUMER_CANCEL_DELAY=10 docker-compose up -d tableinator graphinator

# Send test completion messages
python test_consumer_cancellation.py

# Watch the logs
docker-compose logs -f tableinator graphinator
```

## Edge Cases Handled

1. **Multiple Completion Messages**: If multiple completion messages are received, only one cancellation is scheduled
1. **Service Restart**: Consumer tags are lost on restart, but the feature continues to work for new messages
1. **Cancellation Failure**: Failures are logged but don't crash the service
1. **Grace Period**: Ensures all in-flight messages are processed before cancellation

## Technical Details

- Uses aio_pika's `queue.cancel(consumer_tag, nowait=True)` to cancel consumers
- Consumer tags are stored when consumers are created
- Cancellation tasks are tracked to allow proper cleanup on shutdown
- The `nowait=True` parameter prevents hanging if RabbitMQ is slow to respond
