## 📋 Workflows

Discogsography uses GitHub Actions for continuous integration, testing, and deployment automation. All workflows follow
consistent patterns with emojis for visual clarity and optimal performance through parallelization and caching.

### 🏗️ Build Workflow (`build.yml`)

**Trigger**: Push to main, PRs, two scheduled crons, manual dispatch **Purpose**: Main CI pipeline that orchestrates all
quality checks and Docker builds

```yaml
on:
  push:
    branches: [main]
  pull_request:
    branches: [main]
  schedule:
    - cron: "0 1 * * 6"  # Saturday 01:00 UTC — full build
    - cron: "0 4 * * 1"  # Monday 04:00 UTC — security-focused build
  workflow_dispatch:
```

**Jobs**:

1. **Detect Changes** 🔍 - Determines which files changed for conditional execution
1. **List Sub-Projects** 📋 - Provides service matrix for downstream jobs
1. **Code Quality** ✅ - Runs linting and formatting checks
1. **Security** 🛡️ - Comprehensive security scanning
1. **Docker Compose Validate** 🐳 - Validates docker-compose syntax
1. **Docker Validate** 🐳 - Dockerfile linting and build testing
1. **Tests** 🧪 - Executes unit and integration tests (parallel with E2E)
1. **E2E Tests** 🎭 - Browser-based testing (parallel with unit tests)

## 🔧 Composite Actions

Reusable actions that reduce duplication and improve maintainability:

### 📦 `setup-python-uv`

Sets up Python environment with UV package manager and caching.

```yaml
- uses: ./.github/actions/setup-python-uv
  with:
    python-version: "3.13"
    cache-dependency-glob: "**/uv.lock"
```

- 💾 Intelligent dependency caching
- ⚡ Cache restoration with fallbacks

### 🐳 `docker-build-cache`

Advanced Docker layer caching for faster builds.

```yaml
- uses: ./.github/actions/docker-build-cache
  with:
    service-name: dashboard
    dockerfile-path: dashboard/Dockerfile
    use-cache: true
```

**Features**:

- 💾 BuildKit cache optimization
- 🔄 Cache hit detection
- 📊 Performance metrics
- 🎯 Service-specific caching

## ⚡ Performance Optimizations

### 🚀 Parallelization

- Tests and E2E tests run in parallel after code quality
- Independent Docker builds use matrix strategy
- Concurrent browser tests limited to prevent resource exhaustion

### 💾 Caching Strategy

- **Hierarchical cache keys** with multiple fallback levels
- **Docker BuildKit** inline caching and cache namespaces
- **Dependency caching** for Python, UV, and pre-commit
- **Test result caching** for faster subsequent runs

### 🎯 Conditional Execution

- Skip tests when no relevant files changed in PRs
- Smart file change detection for targeted workflows
- Resource-aware execution based on context

### 📊 Monitoring & Metrics

- Build duration tracking
- Cache hit rate reporting
- Performance notices in workflow logs
- Enhanced Discord notifications with metrics

## 🛡️ Security Features

### 🔒 Least Privilege Permissions

All workflows specify minimal required permissions:

```yaml
permissions:
  contents: read        # Most workflows
  packages: write      # For Docker push
  pull-requests: write # For PR creation
```

### 📌 Action Pinning

- Non-GitHub/Docker actions pinned to specific SHA
- Regular updates through dependabot
- Version comments for clarity

### 🐳 Container Security

- Non-root user execution (1000:1000)
- No-new-privileges security option
- Trivy container and filesystem scanning for HIGH/CRITICAL CVEs
- Anchore security scanning for images
- Hadolint validation for Dockerfiles

## 🎯 Best Practices

### 📝 Naming Conventions

- **Steps**: Start with emoji for visual scanning
- **Jobs**: Descriptive names with purpose
- **Workflows**: Clear, action-oriented names

### 🎨 Quote Standardization

- **Expressions**: Single quotes (`${{ }}`)
- **YAML strings**: Double quotes when needed
- **Simple values**: Unquoted when appropriate

### 📢 Notifications

- Discord webhooks for build status
- Detailed error messages in logs
- PR comments for dependency updates
- Workflow status badges in README

### 🔧 Maintenance

- Weekly dependency updates
- Monthly Docker image cleanup
- Automated cache management
- Regular security scanning

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Running Workflows Locally

Use [act](https://github.com/nektos/act) to test workflows locally:

```bash
# Run specific workflow
act -W .github/workflows/test.yml

# Run with specific event
act pull_request -W .github/workflows/build.yml

# List available workflows
act -l
```

### Debugging Workflows

1. **Enable debug logging**:

   ```yaml
   env:
     ACTIONS_RUNNER_DEBUG: true
     ACTIONS_STEP_DEBUG: true
   ```

1. **Add debugging steps**:

   ```yaml
   - name: 🐛 Debug context
     run: |
       echo "Event: ${{ github.event_name }}"
       echo "Ref: ${{ github.ref }}"
       echo "SHA: ${{ github.sha }}"
   ```

1. **Check workflow runs**: Navigate to Actions tab in GitHub
