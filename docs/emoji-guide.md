### ASCII Art Integration

Emojis are NOT used in ASCII art banners. Keep ASCII art pure text for compatibility.

### Consistency Rules

1. Use emojis at the start of log messages, not in the middle
1. One emoji per message/header (avoid emoji overload)
1. Keep emoji usage consistent within each service
1. Use status emojis (✅❌⚠️) for clear state communication
1. Service emojis should match across logs, docs, and UI

## Adding New Emojis

When adding new emojis:

1. Check this guide first for existing appropriate emojis
1. Ensure the emoji renders correctly across platforms
1. Add the new emoji to this guide with clear usage instructions
1. Use semantic emojis that relate to their purpose
1. Avoid ambiguous or culturally specific emojis

## Quick Reference Table

### Most Common Emojis

- 🚀 = Starting/launching
- ✅ = Success/complete
- ❌ = Error/failure
- ⚠️ = Warning/caution
- 🔄 = Processing/working
- 📊 = Data/analytics
- 🎵 = Music/discovery
- 🔗 = Links/connections
- 💾 = Saved/stored
- 🔧 = Config/setup

Remember: Emojis enhance readability but should not be required for understanding. Always include clear text
descriptions alongside emojis.
