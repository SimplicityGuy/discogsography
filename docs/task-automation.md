# Task Automation with just

> 🤖 Streamlined development workflows using just task automation

This project uses [just](https://github.com/casey/just) for task automation, providing a simple and intuitive interface
similar to `make` or npm scripts. All tasks are defined in the `justfile` in the project root.

## 🚀 Quick Start

```bash
# Run any task
just <task-name>

# List all available tasks
just --list

# List tasks by group
just --list --list-heading ''

# Common workflows
just install      # Setup development environment
just lint         # Check code quality
just test         # Run test suite
just up           # Start all services
```

## 📋 Available Tasks

Tasks are organized into logical groups for easier navigation:
