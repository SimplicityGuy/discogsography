Enhanced auto-implementation with intelligent code generation and testing.

Arguments: $ARGUMENTS

## Intelligent Auto-Implementation

Advanced implementation with context awareness and quality checks.

### 1. **Pre-Implementation Analysis**

Before starting:

- Analyze task complexity and requirements
- Check codebase patterns and conventions
- Identify similar completed tasks
- Assess test coverage needs
- Detect potential risks

### 2. **Smart Implementation Strategy**

Based on task type and context:

**Feature Tasks**

1. Research existing patterns
1. Design component architecture
1. Implement with tests
1. Integrate with system
1. Update documentation

**Bug Fix Tasks**

1. Reproduce issue
1. Identify root cause
1. Implement minimal fix
1. Add regression tests
1. Verify side effects

**Refactoring Tasks**

1. Analyze current structure
1. Plan incremental changes
1. Maintain test coverage
1. Refactor step-by-step
1. Verify behavior unchanged

### 3. **Code Intelligence**

**Pattern Recognition**

- Learn from existing code
- Follow team conventions
- Use preferred libraries
- Match style guidelines

**Test-Driven Approach**

- Write tests first when possible
- Ensure comprehensive coverage
- Include edge cases
- Performance considerations

### 4. **Progressive Implementation**

Step-by-step with validation:

```
Step 1/5: Setting up component structure ✓
Step 2/5: Implementing core logic ✓
Step 3/5: Adding error handling ⚡ (in progress)
Step 4/5: Writing tests ⏳
Step 5/5: Integration testing ⏳

Current: Adding try-catch blocks and validation...
```

### 5. **Quality Assurance**

Automated checks:

- Linting and formatting
- Test execution
- Type checking
- Dependency validation
- Performance analysis

### 6. **Smart Recovery**

If issues arise:

- Diagnostic analysis
- Suggestion generation
- Fallback strategies
- Manual intervention points
- Learning from failures

### 7. **Post-Implementation**

After completion:

- Generate PR description
- Update documentation
- Log lessons learned
- Suggest follow-up tasks
- Update task relationships

Result: High-quality, production-ready implementations.
